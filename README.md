# Laravel-Test-Project
A project where I will be learning Laravel and messing around with concepts that I want to learn and try.

## Installation Instructions

To run this project, you must have laravel installed. I have it working with homstead, however it also works with standard laravel.
The database setup for this project is stored in the .env file, so you will need to edit this to work with your db setup. 

If you have any issues getting this to run or any questions, please send me an email an I will try to help/answer.
